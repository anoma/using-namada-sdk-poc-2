# Namada Desktop Client (SDK usage)

This mini project attempts to perform a whole transaction for initiation account. It does not really work yet, but it explores the usage of the various necessary utilities, mostly for persisting data, promoting user for input and performing various tasks where files are being read.

> :warning: This is not using or promoting real data so it does not really work for submitting transactions at it's current state. Some parts are just place holders that just keep the compiler happy
